	This is my first git repository and a test to see if this works. 
	I'm learning how to use git in an effort to prepare myself for a
	code school by the name of "Portland Code School", let's hope this works.
	After doing some research I have decided to attend Epicodus instead of
	Portland Code School. I love how open the program is and the value of 
	the tuition pricing. And they do projects for non-profits, how cool is 
	that!?
