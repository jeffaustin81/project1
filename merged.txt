	This is my first git repository and a test to see if this works. 
	I'm learning how to use git in an effort to prepare myself for a
	code school by the name of "Portland Code School", let's hope this works.

	This is the second text file I am creating. Testing edit on file2.txt...
	After doing some research I have decided to apply at Epicodus instead of
	Portland Code School. I love how open the program is and the value of 
	the tuition pricing. And they do projects for non-profits, how cool is 
	that!?
        
	I got accepted into Epicodus! 
        I will be learning PHP, Drupal, JavaScript, and AngularJS! I'm so excited. 
        This is gonna be amazing! Stay tuned as I will be adding projects soon!
